Glyf iOS Open Source
============

An example native iOS app created using Xcode.

Builds as-is for iOS: iPhone http://www.glyf.io/

You will need to add your own API keys for linked services in AppDelegate.swift

Dependencies:
- Parse (for back-end - PARSE WILL SHUT DOWN IN JANUARY 2017, so Glyf will shut down then)
- Facebook SDK (for login)
- Google Maps SDK (for location searches and metadata)
- Mixpanel (for logging events)
- Cocoapods

Offered entirely as-is. This git repository has not been tested to confirm that it builds correctly.
